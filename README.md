<h1>Shutter Encoder Hap Edition v8.0</h1>

![logo](/SocialBanner.png)

## Changes compared to the original version
- Added fast Hap R encoding path (both RGB and RGBA modes supported - also use for high quality videos with alpha channel)
- Multi-threaded Hap encoding, which is very fast on multi-core CPUs
- Hap 15% faster compared to the original Shutter Encoder
- Support for fully GPU based format based on GDeflate compression algorithm - dramatically decreases the CPU usage for Hap, and also 20-40% reduced file size (Unity DX12 only at the moment)
